#  Simple Audio Player â€“ Python + Kivy

>  This is a **simple and educational music player**, not a full-featured media application.  

---

##  How It Works

This app allows you to play music from your local folder using a custom Kivy-based UI.  
It supports basic playback controls and automatically displays song-specific images if provided.

###  Music Files
Place your `.mp3`, `.wav`, or `.ogg` files in:
assets/music/


###  Cover Images (Optional)
You can display a custom image for each song by placing an image in:
assets/icons/

- The image **must have the same name** as the song (excluding the extension).
- Example:
assets/music/my_song.mp3
assets/icons/my_song.png


- Supported image formats:
`.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`, `.bmp`, `.tiff`, `.webp`, `.svg`, `.ico`, `.heic`, `.tif`, `.raw`

- If no matching image is found, a default image will be used from:
assets/icons/Default.png
